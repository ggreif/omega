--test_aww (coerce -> (Just a)) = coerce a -- BUG?? Couldn't match representation of type ‘a0’ with that of ‘Bool’


-- PLAN: can we outsource the type checking of this to a plugin
--       in the style of http://adam.gundry.co.uk/pub/typechecker-plugins/

-- (°) must be injective in the second arg
-- implement the right refinement semantics

-- Can a plugin see
--      test_aww (Just a) = a
-- at all?
-- Or do we need Template haskell for that to massage it first?

-- * Todos

-- - add a Servant-style typeclass (fundep?) to create (pattern-matching?) wrapper
--   around a degree-typed function, eliminating the degrees in the process.
-- - in TH consider universally qualified tyvars coming from a degree as
--   /scope-extended/ tyvars (a.k.a. pi-binders)
