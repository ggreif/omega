-- ### The PLAN ###
--
-- o reimplement the functionality from CircularFinal.hs
--   in terms of strongly typed islands.
-- o `unify` will get this signature: Term (is :: [k]) -> Term (is' :: [k]) -> Term (is \/ is')
-- o context lookup will be: Identifier is -> Ctx continents -> Obligations (os :: [(is, conts_n)]
-- o Can we have Contexts as type classes and terms as type aliases with "value in a context"?
