Normally unification is presented in catergory-theoreic terms as a coequalizer:

we have an indexed set of equations s_i = t_i where the ${s_i, t_i}$ are terms.
Then we ask the algorithm for a most generic unifier $q$ .

TODO: describe how the unification works.

The first observation is that why not only deal with substitutions only? I.e. invent a finite set of variable names $vl_i$ and $vr_i$ and let those point to $s_i$ resp. $t_i$. Then we have a bona fide substitution $V \to T_{\Omega}W$, where $W$ is the variable set of our terms ${s_i, t_i}$.

The second observation is that having substitutions with just variables as the substituend kills the symmetry in the unification algorithm. (HOW SO?) So we'll forbid $v \to w$ substitutions altogether. Now when we encounter a unification necessity $v \equiv w$ what should we do?
My suggestion is to create an equivalence class of variable names that contains both $v$ and $w$. We'll revisit this issue later but for now it is enough to hint at path-connectedness (i.e. \emph groupoids).

Then the domain of our Kleisli-arrows must be equivalence classes of variable names. Since a single variable name in $T_{\Omega}W$ uniquely determines the equivalence class of variable names, why not also pass to quotients in $T_{\Omega}W$?
