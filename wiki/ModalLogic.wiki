Box and partial evaluation ("known"). Applying a known function to a known argument gives us a known result.

`□(Int → Int) → □Int → □Int` works like this:
(1+) 5 → 6
Some calculations can run at compile time. _Note that we do need to know the innards of `(1+)` to be able to run it.

This is the essence of an applicative functor: `□(Int → Int) → □Int → □Int`

Löb is `□(□a → a) → □a`
