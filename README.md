# About
This is a repository containing work of [Tim Sheard](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~sheard) on the programming
language Ωmega. Lateron it has been maintained by Gabor Greif. Very little is expected to change here.

# Documents
You may find some PDFs of interest in the /doc folder.

# History
Earlier Ωmega lived in the now defunct [GoogleCode site](https://code.google.com/archive/p/omega).
With some luck one can still see content there.
