This directory contains imported code
of relevant algorithms which are *not*
part of the Omega project.

Currently two algorithms are present:

o "Practical type inference for arbitrary-rank types" by Peyton Jones et al.
  http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/higher-rank/
 
o "Algorithm P" from Chuan-kai Lin's PhD thesis
  http://sites.google.com/site/chklin/research
