                 Cayenne to make equality proofs readable. 1
                 Introduction Equality proofs are important for
                 functional programs, since they are encouraged by
                 equational reasoning. Unfortunately, type theory style
                 equational proofs are tedious and look very ugly. Let
                 us illustrate this with an example. We wish to prove
                 that list append is associative. The function has the
                 following denition: Nil ++ ys = ys (x : xs) ++ ys = x :
                 (xs ++ ys) Now we want to establish that (xs++ys)++zs =
                 xs++(ys++zs). With normal notation we do this with an
                 inductive proof 1 as follows. Base case: (Nil++ys)++zs
                 = by rst clause of ++ = ys++zs = by rst clause of ++,
                 reversed = Nil++(ys++zs) Inductive step:
                 ((x:xs)++ys)++zs = by second clause of ++ =
                 (x:(xs++ys))++zs = by second clause of ++ =
                 x:((xs++ys)++zs) = by induction hypothesis =
                 x:(xs++(ys++zs)) = by second clause of ++, reversed =
                 (x:xs)++(ys++zs) Now compare this to the same proof in
                 type theory style. W...",

  abstract =     "Alf is an interactive proof editor. It is based on the
                 idea that to prove a mathematical theorem is to build a
                 proof object for the theorem. The proof object is
                 directly manipulated on the screen, different
                 manipulations correspond to different steps in the
                 proof. The language we use is Martin-Lof's monomorphic
                 type theory. This is a small functional programming
                 language with dependent types. The language is open in
                 the sense that it is easy to introduce new inductively
                 defined sets. A proof is represented as a mathematical
                 object and a proposition is identified with the set of
                 its proof objects. Background During the years we have
                 learned that there is no such thing as {"}the logic of
                 programming{"}. Different kinds of programs require
                 different kind of reasoning. Programs are manipulating
                 different kinds of objects, and it would be very
                 awkward to code these objects into a fixed set of
                 objects. Objects have their own logic, it is for
                 instance very different to reason about ongoing

                 are traditionally implemented via general recursion,
                 with separate proofs for partial correctness and
                 termination. The latter tends to involve counting the
                 number of unsolved variables and showing that this
                 total decreases each time a substitution enlarges the
                 terms. There are many such proofs in the literature,
                 for example, (Manna \& Waldinger, 1981; Paulson, 1985;
