\begin{abstract}
In this short note we shall describe a curious connection
between non-standard arithmetics and weak equivalences
in higher categories, with special focus on the category of
opetopes. At the heart of the correspondence lies the
connection between opetopic composition and non-standard
multiplication. Weak equivalences of the same composites are
witnessed by universal cells. Universality between two
composite cells is then observed by a vanishing standard
part of the commutator applied to the corresponding formulas.
The presence of a non-vanishing error term (non-standard part)
is the consequence of the broken referential transparency of
operadic composition.
While the connection between operad algebras and
lie algebras appears to be well-known, this particular
case does not appear to be discussed.

\section{Introduction}
A very superfical introduction to non-standard analysis
and to weak equivalences in higher categories is due.
