Name:                omega
Version:             1.5.2
Synopsis:            A purely functional programming language and a proof system

Description:         Omega is a purely functional programming language (like Haskell)
                     and it also enables built-in proofs about program correctness
                     employing the Curry-Howard correspondence. Powerful metaprogramming
                     facilities and extensible syntax for data make programming a less
                     verbose experience.
